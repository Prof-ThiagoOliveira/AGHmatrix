# AGHmatrix
This R package aims to compute and analyse A (pedigree), G (genomic-base), and H (A corrected by G) matrices for diploid and autotetraploid species to later be used in prediction models. At the moment, just the A matrix part is fully working and documented. G matrix is working for files - input part needs to be converted to Rdata format. G matrix calculation methods are based on diploid species and has not been shown a good way to approach higher ploidy data.
Please go to the tutorial inside the vignettes folder for more information.
